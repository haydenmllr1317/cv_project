The code for each model implementation can be found in:
    Unet:
      ./models/UNet.py
    CLIP-based:
      ./models/CLIP_Segmenter.py

The training scripts are configured to match our final training runs
To replicate them run:
    ./trainUNet.py
    ./trainCLIP.py


The code for the perturbations is in:
    ./perturbUtil.py
And for testing the model in:
    ./perturbEval.py

The script for measuring a models performance across splits is:
    ./evaluateModel.py
The code for the metrics requested is in:
    ./evalUtil.py

Lastly:
    ./customDataset.py
        The code for data loading and data augmentations.
    ./graphUtil.py
        A script used to make the graphs in the report and during training.
    ./util.py
        Small collection of usefull functions/things we needed.






If you need to run the code:
1) Make sure to extract the "TrainVal" and "Test" folders from the dataset into:
    ./Dataset
2) Make and activate a virtual enviroment:
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
3) Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

We used python 3.12.3, though 3.10-3.11 likely also work.
Training requires at least 5gb vram (maybe bit less),
    and should take less than an hour for each model on a decent system.
Outputs will be saved in a ./Runs folder.
